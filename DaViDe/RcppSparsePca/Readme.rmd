## Code for estimation of Sparse PCA

The files in this folder estimate sparse PCA with RcppArmadillo. This is a great benefit for the speed of your simulations! 

Before uploading the R function 'regularizedSca.r', don't forget to source the Rcpp code by means of : 
```
Rcpp::sourceCpp( 'estimateSca.cpp' )
```
where estimateSca.cpp contains the C++ code file.
