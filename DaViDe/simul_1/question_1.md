Alright guys, here's my first question. I implemented the function to iteratively generate the data, but there's something wrong with it.
As I increase the number of iterations, the convergence criterion increases instead of going to 0. I also noted the values of the X matrix 
increase at each iteration...

So if you have time can you tell me what am I doing so dumb? Is my updating implementation and my convergence criterion (ss of differences 
between matrices). In the folder 'simul_1' you can find the following files : 

 - functions.r which contains functions to scale matrices, calculate sum of squares, and others; 
 - genData.r the funtion to generate data
 - simul.r  The main function; you will find all step by stepp instructions (and questions) in this file. 
 
 Thanks for your help guys! If you have suggestions for improvement implement it or let me know by comments! :*
